# My Content Tracker App

This project is now built with [**Expo**](https://expo.dev/) for React Native, making development and testing easier across platforms.

---

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) installed before proceeding.

## 1. Install Dependencies

```sh
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

## 2. Start the Expo Development Server

```sh
npx expo start
# or
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

This will open the Expo Dev Tools in your browser. You can then run the app on:
- **iOS simulator** (if on macOS)
- **Android emulator**
- **Physical device** (scan the QR code with the Expo Go app)

## 3. Modifying Your App

Edit `App.tsx` or any file in the `src/` directory. The app will automatically reload with your changes.

## 4. Debugging

Expo provides several tools and methods to help you debug your app:

## 1. Accessing Logs
- Use the Expo Dev Tools in your browser (automatically opens with `npx expo start`).
- View logs directly in your terminal where the Expo server is running.
- For device logs, use the Expo Go app and shake your device to open the developer menu.

## 2. Debugging JavaScript
- Press `d` in the terminal to open the browser-based DevTools.
- Use `console.log()` statements in your code to print debug information.
- You can also use the Chrome or Edge debugger:
  - Open the developer menu (shake device or press `Ctrl+m`/`Cmd+m` in emulator/simulator).
  - Select "Debug JS Remotely" to open a debugger in your browser.

## 3. Setting Breakpoints
- Use the browser DevTools to set breakpoints and inspect variables when "Debug JS Remotely" is enabled.
- You can also use [React Native Debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger) for advanced debugging.

## 4. Reloading and Hot Reload
- Save your files to trigger fast refresh (hot reload).
- To force a full reload, open the developer menu and select "Reload".

## 5. Common Issues
- If the app is not updating, try clearing the cache: `npx expo start -c`
- Restart the Expo server and your device if you encounter persistent issues.
- See the [Expo Debugging Guide](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/debugging/) for more tips.

## 5. Building for Production

See the [Expo build documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/) for details on building standalone apps for iOS and Android.

# Expo Folder

The `.expo` folder is generated by Expo and **should not be committed to version control**. It is already included in `.gitignore`.

---

# Troubleshooting

If you have issues running the app, try the following:
- Clear the Expo cache: `npx expo start -c`
- Restart your development server and device
- See the [Expo Troubleshooting Guide](https://docs.expo.dev/troubleshooting/common-issues/)
